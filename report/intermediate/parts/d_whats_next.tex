\section{Further development}
\label{section:further_development}

Due to limited time available this intermediate report and the current state of the project isn't overwhelming in any stretch of the imagination.
Because of this, a special thanks is given to the teacher and teaching assistants who've softened the requirements for the intermediate report.

In the time available until the final deadline many new possibilities for creating a better model will be explored, this might include but is not limited to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Preprocessing can be explored.
    \item The different descriptors can be compared with each other.
    \item More available models need to be tested and compared to the linear baseline model.
    \item Nesting multiple good performing models might be an option, using weighted probabilities.
    \item TODO XXX
\end{itemize}

Some aspects of the created models and pipeline might also be modified further once the open issues discussed in section \ref{section:open_issues} are resolved.

\section{Open issues}
\label{section:open_issues}

While developing the first models many questions arose. Most are already answered by googling or discussion with colleagues. Open questions that are not yet answered are listed below, for which guidance from the teaching assistants is asked.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The data is not available as a pickle file for the SURF descriptor.
    \item TODO XXX
\end{itemize}
