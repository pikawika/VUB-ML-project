\chapter*{Abstract}

This intermediate report documents the development of an animal classification AI using a more "old-school" approach of Visual-Bag-of-Words models.
These models, and thus the AI, are developed in Python-based Jupyter Notebooks accompanied with this document.
This animal classification AI was developed as a fulfillment of the Machine Learning course requirements.

Part \ref{part:about_the_code} discusses the accompanied code in general. Section \ref{section:inc_files} explains which files are accompanied and which are the most important. 
Section \ref{section:ideology_dev_code} describes the ideology used to created the code. 
To make testing multiple models easier, a \emph{pipeline} was created and is discussed in section \ref{section:typical_pass_through_pipeline}.

Finally, part \ref{part:whats_next} discusses future plans for this project. Section \ref{section:further_development} lists possible topics that can be explored to create a better animal classification AI. In the last section, section \ref{section:open_issues}, some open issues are discussed.
