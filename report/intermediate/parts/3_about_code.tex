This report was created in \LaTeX{} by modifying the excellent and well-known VUB themed template from Ruben De Smet (\citeyear{latex_template}). BibLaTeX was used for reference management and natbib was used for more citation control. 

Most source files, for this report and the created models, are available on GitHub \citep{github_project}. Some files, like the used training images, were not included in this GitHub repository. Details about this can be found on the GitHub page (README file). The supplied code is written in Python-based Jupyter Notebooks. Rights to this GitHub repository can be asked from the author.
