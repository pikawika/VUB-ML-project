Feedback:

Don’t put in too much fluff and repeat stuff. I know you mean well, but it sometimes hinders readability of your document. Also, 25p is simply way too much for the intermediate (and even final) report.

Why do you leave out features? Or what do you mean by ‘feature amounts’?

A bit more text on figures (it’s great that you include them though)

Include all scores, also Kaggle scores.

Numbers in your CM!

Try to put your figures in the text for readability.

Preprocessing is a crucial part of the model, you mention the opposite.

SURF is left out by intention, if you want to use it, you can follow some tips in the first part of the vbow notebook.

Your comment on the class_weight parameter is great, it shows that you ask the right questions. I won’t give away the actual answer to it, though, since it is important for your progress/report. Your next comment is related to it: I also can’t answer it directly, but I like that you think about these things, so good job already.


General feedback:

Excellent start. I see a lot of good things, but also some (small) errors, which is normal of course.
